(1) EXPAND CAPABILITIES
- include Tesco
- enable ability to read from pdf files and create a representative basket
- ensure we can get loyalty and non-loyalty PRICES
- factor in delivery costs

(2) IMPROVE YOUR CURRENT PROTOTYPE FILE CODE
- CLEAN 'CLEANING CODE' FOR SAINSBURY
- INCORPORATE ALL CURRENT PRODUCTS IN COMPARISON AND FIGURE HOW TO MATCH FRUITS
- SEE HOW MUCH YOU CAN GENERALISE (E.G., NO NEED TO TAKE OUT LONGLIFE)
- EXPERIMENT WITH BETTER MATCH TYPES?
- WHAT TO DO WITH TASTE THE DIFFERENCE - MAY BE LABEL AS TD? OTHERWISE MATCH IS WAY OFF
- HOW TO INCLUDE M&S WHEN NO OCADO SUBSTITUTE
- INCLUDE PRE-PROMO PRICES AT OCADO AND MORRISON AND INCLUDE MULTI-BUY - CUSTOMERS MAY WANT TO KNOW
- INCLUDE MORE PRODUCTS LIKE OUST SCALER (be exhaustive) 

(3) THEN
- Should we want customers to build their basket? Front-end choices?
- Read pdf data into generic data and convert this into inputs (e.g. generalise - take ocado, sainsbury etc out)
- Incorporate multi-buy discounts at both retailer
- Decide which of the products to keep after scraping for comparison ['INTENSE FUZZY WORK']
- Use streamlit for front-end where you can ask users to upload order data
- Print cost, and items not compared
- Print delivery costs not included
